Idea of the game:
My first real 'game' in ASM for the TI-83Plus.
The idea is simple: to keep going as long as possible.
You are the snake that just will not stop growing- you move around
trying not to eat yourself or hit the walls. Every so often a 'magic
dot' appears, eat it and you magically shrink back down!

How to play:
Sen the file kpgoing.8xp to your calc (Ti-83Plus) 
Run the game by typing 'Asm(prgmKPGOING)' at the home screen.
After the splash screen, hit 1, 2 or 3 to select speed.
You start in the top left, moving right. Use the arrow keys to move.
When you spot a pip, eat it to shrink back again.
Press 'Clear' at any time to quit.
If asked to play again, press 'Y' (really it should be '1').
Try to get a high score!

Source code:
I don't do comments :)
Try to decipher it yourself. (OK, I suck at ASM. Who cares? This game
is fun (or at least more fun than the maths your meant to use the calc
for!))

Bugs/Problems:
+Key handling is odd: only press Up/Down/Left/Right/Clear. Other keys 
won't crash the calc, but might do odd things: Enter, for instance, 
does the same thing as the Down key!
+Nit-picking really: when you exit, it fails to dump you at the Home
screen properly. You need to press Clear after the game to do so. (It
puts you on the Graph Screen, no axes, no graph). Truly odd. Any ideas?
